# AugmentedIndependenceDay
An Augmented Reality application in which we can celebrate independence day with virtual soldiers and flag

It is an Augmented Reality based application in which we can celebrate our independence day with the help of technology. I with my one friend
Rushi Shah made this app on 15 August, 2018 in which you have to click on the ground and our flag will augment with two army man and our
National Anthem will start.

It was a simple try from our side to celebrate our independence day in more innovative and immersive way with the help of technology :) 

In this Unity and Vuforia SDK are used.
